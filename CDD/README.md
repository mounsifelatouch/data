# CDD: Machine Learning Project Data Sets
This folder contains the data sets necessary to perform a machine learning project in the field of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR). The data sets were collected from ChEMBL and were pre-processed for use in a QSAR model for bioactivity prediction.

## Contents
- [`data_set_1.csv`](./data_set_1.csv): A data set containing chemical compounds and their associated bioactivity values.
- [`data_set_2.csv`](./data_set_2.csv): A data set containing molecular descriptors and their corresponding bioactivity values.
- [`data_set_3.csv`](./data_set_3.csv): A data set containing physicochemical properties of chemical compounds.
- `README.md`: This file, containing information about the contents of the folder.
## Usage
The data sets in this folder can be used to train and test machine learning models for QSAR applications. Please refer to the individual data set files for information on the contents and format of each data set.

## Credits
The data sets in this folder were collected and pre-processed by [mounsifelatouch@gmail.com ](mounsifelatouch@gmail.com). If you use these data sets in your research, please acknowledge the source by citing this GitHub repository.

Feel free to customize this README to include any additional information that may be relevant to your project. Good luck with your machine learning project!
